# WonderCook Data Centric Milestone 3 Project

Deployed project: https://wondercook-book.herokuapp.com/get_recipes

This project studies the interaction between users and handling data from front-end to back-end of websites.

My project is a playground/boilerplate to understand how Python manages data in between the front-end and the back-end of websites. Python is a versatile and exciting language with a billion of sources, the Python library has been where I spend most of my time learning about how to do stuff depending on the users’ context and interaction.

This is my begging connecting a database with a website, and how to show that information on a card or column on the front-end, as this project evolves, I want to use this process as my journey of the main core of the UX design practices. This is more like a studying messy room where I’m putting all my ideas together.

# UX Practices
![User Stories Wireframe](https://github.com/kervo/DataCentric_MS3/blob/master/static/img/page-mochup.png)

My colour scheme for Materialize: pink-text text-darken-4

The fontawesone icons use in this application are food related as this is a recipes database.

To make it easier for users to log into their profile's section, email has been removed from the credentials.

In order to have a nice centred panel on *register.html* we need to use `<div class="col s12 m8 offset-m2">` where offset-m2 would push the card two spaces to the left.

* Using fontawesone icons:
`<i class="fas fa-key prefix"></i>` PREFIX class allows the fontawesone icon to be displayed as part of the text.


# Software Development Practices:
![User Stories Wireframe](https://github.com/kervo/DataCentric_MS3/blob/master/static/img/wireframe-user%20stories.png)

* The Structure

Index
```
|—Log in
---| <user> <session>
---| Dashboard
        |—Search recipes <recipe>
        |—Add Recipe
        |—Edit a recipe
        |—Delete a recipe
        |—Log out <session>

|— register
    <username>, <email>, <password>



|—Index with random recipes <random>
```

To create the folders on the command line:
`mkdir templates`

For this project we used MATERIALIZE: https://materializecss.com/getting-started.html

In order to add a nice margin around the content, on the base.html file is important to have this structure:

```python
<div class="container">
      {% block content %}
      {% endblock %}
</div>
```
* The Categories
The main problem at the moment is displaying the meal type on from the select list. I have it in MongoDB as an array, I think the best is to have them as different entries in a collection so the can have the same key value of "meal_time".

* User Functionality
![User Functions](https://github.com/kervo/DataCentric_MS3/blob/master/static/img/IMG_4346.PNG)
Only registered users can CRUD their on recipes, not registerted users are redirected to log in page.

Technologies used
HTML, CSS, Javascript as part of the templates. Python3, Flask and MongoDB for the back-end.

### Handling errors
Loading the page for the first time and click on the *ME* link without starting a session was throwing a 404 error, the best practice is to ask the users to log in.
```html
{% if session.user|lower == recipes.wonderchef|lower %}
```

## Testing

### Problem: "password": generate_password_hash(request.form.get("password"))
* Message: TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'NoneType'.
* Solution: password input field wasn't correctly marked as `type="password"` and it wasn't marked as required field which causes error with the Werkzeug package.

### Problem: jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'get_flasehd_messages' is undefined
* Solution: typo

### Problem: jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'recipe' is undefined
* Solution: Edit_recipe section was throwing this error, I had to link my edit function `recipe_id` with the actual collection on the data base `recipes`
Wrong code:
```html
<a href="{{ url_for('edit_recipe', recipe_id=recipe._id) }}
```
Correction:
```html
<a href="{{ url_for('edit_recipe', recipe_id=recipes._id) }}
```
### Problem: raise ValueError('update only works with $ operators')
* Solution: `.update()` for mongo.db.recipes.update_one({"_id": ObjectId(recipe_id)}, edit_recipe)

# Defensive Design 
### Denied access to functions and links if is not a user:
```html
{% if session.user|lower == recipes.wonderchef|lower %}
```
This codes will allow to use certain functions and links when users log in.

### 404 Errors
```python
@app.errorhandler(404)
def not_found(e):
    return render_template("404.html")
```
This piece of code simply redirects to the logic page for any 404 errors that may occur on a user's session.

```html
<input id="username" name="username" type="text" minlength="5" maxlength="20" pattern="^[a-zA-Z0-9]{5,20}$" class="validate" required>
```

This piece of code shows that minimum characters are five, maximum 20 and the alpha numberic only. Any exception will be flashed.

### Problem: 127.0.0.1 - - [30/Oct/2020 08:00:55] "GET /login HTTP/1.1" 200 - 127.0.0.1 - - [30/Oct/2020 08:01:14] "POST /register HTTP/1.1" 302 -
* Solution: I was getting redirected to the login page with its flash messages, my Log in page was taken action to POST on the register function rather that the login function.

### pymongo.errors.InvalidOperation: cannot set options after executing query
Calling information `{{ recipes.recipe_name }}` from the data base added on a template after the `{% endfor %}`

### IndexError: no such item for Cursor instance
Problem to call values from array into `<select>` list on my add_recipe function.

## Deployment on the command line

`pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

Procfile file for Heroku app running:

`web: python app.py`

To wireup Flask and MongoDB:

`pip3 install flask-pymongo`

`pip3 install dnspython`
